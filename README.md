# bootstrap-portfolio

I made my portfolio personalised and work smoothly using Bootstrap. It's this handy tool that helped me arrange everything neatly and make sure it looks good on any device. With Bootstrap, I easily added things like navigation bars and cool slideshows without making the website slow. So, whether you check it on a computer or your phone it works, thanks to Bootstrap!
